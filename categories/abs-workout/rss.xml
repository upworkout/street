&lt;p&gt;I was a 400m sprinter in college and was used to pain and lactic acid, but one of the few things i�ve ever quit in life was a kalsu hybrid workout a couple of weeks ago. Props to chris stellato with 75 reps in 30 minutes, and andrew rozzi 17:56 as rx’d! A couple things about this workout 1) it is deceiving, athletes should be advised to choose a very conservative number of thrusters to do on the min and stay there. It is a brutal one just to do scaled or modified let alone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

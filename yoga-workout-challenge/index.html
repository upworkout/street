Houston Chronicle Yoga Challenge Day Three DownwardFacing Dog From houstonchronicle.com
The proven yoga plans for each day with rest day between 4 or 3 days helps to consistently practice yoga to achieve better results within 30 days. That’s what yoga challenge classes are going to be… we’re going to use a powerful kriyas to perform a full system reboot on our bodies and minds. If you need to, hold the pose for a shorter period of time. It works in a repeating 3 day cycle with day 1 focusing on core, day 2 focusing on balance, and a mixed/general class for day 3.

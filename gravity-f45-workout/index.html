<p>I see people have posted about it before but it seems very unclear what’s going on ? Because f45 is really a great workout and has been one of the few things that has really pushed me to my limits and gotten me in great shape but i also don’t want to force myself to do exercise that doesn’t make me happy anymore. Thankfully not showing any symptoms but stuck at home &amp; losing all those hard earned gains, sure many other f45’ers are in. 😍 We just had to share this&hellip; F45 Training Hurstville.</p>
